# General Data Protection Regulation

The European Union (EU) enacted [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (GDPR) to give its citizens more control over their personal data. GDPR applies to any organization operating within the EU. It also applies to organizations outside of the EU that offer goods or services to customers or businesses in the EU.

System integrators can use the data flow diagrams and database information in the Personal Information Reference to build scripts to resolve use cases similar to the following:

*  A shopper asks for a copy of the data the merchant has stored about her
*  A shopper requests that all information about him be deleted

## Personal Information References

The following topics contain data flow diagrams and database information for Magento version 2.x and Magento version 1.x.
