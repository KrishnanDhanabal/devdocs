# California Consumer Privacy Act

The [California Consumer Protection Act][1]{: target="_blank"} (CCPA) expands the rights of consumers in California to determine how their personal information is collected, stored, and used, with an emphasis on protecting consumers from the unauthorized sale or exchange or their personal information. The CCPA was enacted in 2018 and is effective as of January 1, 2020. 

The CCPA grants the following new rights to consumers:

- **Right to know** the categories of personal information about them that is collected, used, shared, or sold in the past 12 months.
- **Right to delete** certain types of personal information that is held by a business and/or their service provider(s).
- **Right to opt out** of the sale of their personal information.
- **Right to non-discrimination** in terms of price or service for having exercised a privacy right under CCPA.

## Read the CCPA Compliance Guide

A coordinated effort is required to develop and implement a plan to address CCPA compliance. Merchants are encouraged to use the roadmap in the CCPA Compliance Guide to mobilize resources and prioritize tasks so they can move ahead on multiple fronts.

The CCPA Compliance Guide presents a role-based team approach from the perspective of the merchant's business to:

1. Assemble a cross-functional team to address CCPA compliance.

1. **Take inventory of digital properties.**

1. **Map the customer journey and data collection processes.**

1. **Establish procedures and mechanisms to respond to customer requests.**

1. **Write the content for the required CCPA customer notifications.**

1. Review agreements with service providers.

1. Update the privacy policy.

1. Document all CCPA-related procedures and maintain records.

As a software developer, you might be asked to participate as a stakeholder on a merchant's cross-functional  compliance team, with emphasis on steps 2 - 5.
